# OnlineShop
Fictional online store project for the .NET Mentoring Program Advanced course.

In the context of online shopping, there are fundamental models that form the backbone of most e-commerce systems. These models include:

Product:
The product model represents the individual item or service available for purchase on the platform.
It includes attributes such as name, description, price, images, category, and variations (e.g., size, color).
Each product is typically assigned a unique identifier.


Catalog:
The catalog model organizes and manages the collection of products available for sale.
It includes methods for adding, updating, and removing products from the catalog.
Products may be organized into categories or collections to facilitate browsing and search.


Cart:
The cart model represents the temporary storage of selected products by a customer during their shopping session.
It allows customers to add, remove, and update quantities of products before proceeding to checkout.
The cart typically stores product details, quantities, and prices.


Order:
The order model represents a completed transaction where a customer purchases one or more products.
It includes details such as the customer's information, shipping address, payment method, and order status.
Each order is assigned a unique identifier and may contain multiple line items corresponding to the purchased products.


Customer:
The customer model represents individuals or entities who interact with the e-commerce platform by browsing, shopping, and making purchases.
It stores customer information such as name, contact details, shipping addresses, and order history.
Registered customers may have accounts with login credentials for personalized experiences and order tracking.


User:
The user model encompasses individuals or entities engaging with the e-commerce platform, overseeing various functions such as content management, user roles and permissions, order processing, and delivery logistics.
Within this model, diverse roles are allocated to manage distinct aspects of the platform's operations, ranging from overseeing content to administering permissions and executing delivery tasks. These roles may include managers responsible for overall platform management, administrators tasked with user and content management, and couriers focused on order fulfillment and delivery logistics.
